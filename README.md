The provided code example demonstrates a conceptual approach to securely erasing files and directories for educational purposes. It simulates the overwrite process and provides a basic structure for handling directories and files.

The code includes comments explaining each step and includes warnings about ethical hacking. However, it's important to note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used to modify or delete real files or systems.

The simulate_overwrite function simulates the overwriting of files with random data, which is not the same as actual disk erasure. In a real-world scenario, the script would need to perform actual disk writes to overwrite the data.

The tabulrasa_clean function is the main function that iterates over files and directories in the specified directory. It calls the simulate_overwrite function for each file and simulates the deletion of directories.

The confirm_action function prompts the user for explicit consent before proceeding.

The main function creates a test directory and runs the tabulrasa_clean function on it.

To use this script safely, it's important to understand that it is a simulation and should not be executed on real systems or servers. It's designed to demonstrate the concept of secure erasure and should be used with caution in an educational environment.

This script provides a basic structure for handling file and directory deletion and includes safeguards such as explicit consent and a test directory. However, it's important to note that this is a simulation and should not be used to modify or delete real files or systems. It's designed for educational purposes and should be used with caution and proper authorization.
